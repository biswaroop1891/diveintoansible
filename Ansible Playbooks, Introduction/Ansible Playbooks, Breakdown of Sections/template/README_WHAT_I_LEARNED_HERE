This was section 17 of the Udemy Ansible course by James Spurin.

Section: 4 Slide 12


Learned the basic structure of an Ansible playbook. The sections it has; host, vars, tasks, handlers and roles.
Didn't get into roles but covered the rest of the sections.

In the host/target section and we can define playbook keywords. These are bsically variables which override the variables we define in the Inventory file.
Not all variables are available in The Inventory file. But he ones which are present in the Inventory file will be overridden.

vars: In this section we define variables. however we want.
      To call vaiables use "{{ variable_name }}"

Task section we define the task we want to run. basically the things we want to run, we want to do.
We can call handlers to notify us about a task status if that ran with a change or not. 
We can call handlers using 'notify' and a handler name the handler name has to be the same the one we define the handler with.

Handlers: the list of handlers that are executed only when a task is performed and the state is changed. 
THEY DONT RUN WHEN THE TASK DONT RUN OR STATE IS SAME
A handler with same name has to be there to work.

===============
- name: MOTD update centos2 
      copy:
        content: "{{ motd_centos2 }}"
        dest: /etc/motd
      when: ansible_hostname == "centos2"
      notify: MOTD changed centos2 ## Calling the handler with the name defined here.

# Handlers: the list of handlers that are executed only when a task is performed and the state is changed.
#           handlers have same syntax as tasks.
  handlers:
    - name: MOTD changed centos1  ## A handler with same name has to be there to work.
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: The MOTD task has changed successfully on centos1.
